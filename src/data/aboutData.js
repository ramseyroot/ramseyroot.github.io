    `The name is Ramsey Root, a backend developer based in Koforidua, Ghana.
    I'm a very open about my opinions on matters, but I see that may not sit
    well with some people, so I may adjust.
    I think I'm hardworking, but honestly it's more of an obsession than a work ethic.
     I'm introverted, but I can still communicate quite clearly, and in written reports if necessary. 
     I also like systems and patterns, which is probably the root of my interest in tech and economics.

    I'm not looking for a job , really, just worthy projects.
    I  work on freelance projects and utilize some time to built my own projects.

  ` I spend my leisure reading, writing articles, or just watching movies from random genres. 
    I'm learning C++ as a hobby because I've taken a liking to low-level, but that's not work related.
     As always,just trying a hand at more backend frameworks and system design to stay in the loop.
     I love to learn stuff I find useful, or just fun, relevant or not.`,
